# cosmos-bech32-converter
A Bech32 address convertor for Cosmos SDK


Cosmos SDK implemented changes to the format of the bech32 address used on the Cosmos network between the 0.24.2 and 0.25 releases. This script enables users to convert between legacy (pre-0.25) cosmos-sdk bech32 addresses, and the 0.25+ format.

Inspired by bech32 authors and chorus one team.

# Updates
